* About
  This application creates text to speech files from the system clipboard, makes a fifo queue of the sound files
  and plays them in the order they were enqueued.


* Implementation 
  The program has a hard coded path =sound_files= in =/home/user/= where all text to speech files are stored,
  and where the queue is persisted between calls.
  All files are named using the sha3 hash of the text that will be turned to speech.

  [[./layout.png]]
  
  The program has four command line flags:
  + -a: Add to queue
    
    Create a text2speech file and add it to the queue
  + -p: Play 
    
    Start playing the top file of the queue and continue playing all subsequent files, files are deleted when played fully.
  + -j: Merge all into single file
    
    Take all the files on the queue and merge them into a single wav file.
  + -l: List files currently on the queue by name.

    These are currently only done by the hash of the text to be read.

   The shebang used is the file location of the venv python.
   The flags are implemented from argparse.

** Queue persistence 
   + [X] Add/mode descriptions from house kepeing.
     
   Queue from collections is picked and unpicked from the given file.
   The queue function is used from the collections library,
   pickle is used to store a binary representation of the queue in the =stack= file.
   If pickle can't read the file, we assume there is no current stack and create a new one.
   
   #+name:queue-helpers
   #+begin_src python 
     def read_queue():
         '''Read the queue stored in stack, or create new one if an error occurs.
         Return the read in queue.'''
         with open('stack', 'rb') as f:
             try:
                 deq = pickle.load(f)
             except:
                 deq = deque()
                 #Add a delete all wav files here.
         return deq

     def write_queue(q):
         '''Write the queue q into 'stack'.'''
         with open('stack', 'wb') as f:
             pickle.dump(q, f)

     def listen(name):
        #Not used currently
        os.system("xsel | tr '\n' ' ' | espeak -p 100 -s 650 -v male7 -w {}.wav --stdin".format(name))
   #+end_src

** Enqueue files
   We create a sha3 256 object and put all the copied text into it.
   We then digest the text to 16 letters and use that as the name for the wav file generated from the text.
   We run two independant checks: if the text hash is already on the queue and if the wav file generated from the 
   text is in the file system. If either of those is not true we rectify the situation.
   
   *Enqueue* *Lit.py*
   #+name:enqueue
   #+begin_src python 
     def add_to_stack():
         '''Enqueues items on the right end of the queue, write out to the queue persistance file,
            create an text to speech file.
         '''
         m = shake_256()
         name = (os.popen("xsel").read())
         m.update(str.encode(name))
         name = m.hexdigest(16)
         t2t_queue = read_queue()
         on_filesystem = os.path.isfile("{}.wav".format(name))
         on_queue = (name in t2t_queue)
         if not on_queue:
             t2t_queue.append(name)
             write_queue(t2t_queue)
             print(t2t_queue)
         if not on_filesystem:
             os.system("xsel | tr '\n' ' ' | espeak -p 100 -s 650 -v male7 -w {}.wav --stdin".format(name))
         #Delete all files not on the queue.

   #+end_src

** Dequeue files
   We read in the first entered file on the queue, play it and delete it.
   Do this recusively until to files remain on the queue.
   There is a delete option that is used to remove the wav file if it has been played.
   If a file is not found on disk, it is popped off the queue and the program moves to the next file to play.
   
   *Dequeue* *Lit.py*
   #+name:dequeue
   #+begin_src python 
     def pop_from_stack(delete=True):
         '''Dequeue a file from the left end of the queue.'''

         try:
             name = t2t_queue.popleft()
         except IndexError: 
             print('No files quequed up')
             os.system('rm *wav')
             return
         write_queue(t2t_queue)
         check = os.path.isfile("{}.wav".format(name))
         if not check: #see if you can use trys with os.system
             print('No file on disk')
         else:
             os.system('mplayer {}.wav'.format(name))
             if delete:

** Concat files
   This should read all the files on the queue and put them as one large file.
   Not actually tested.

   #+begin_src python 
     def concat_files():

         t2t_queue = read_queue()
         new_files = []
         for i in t2t_queue:
             check = os.path.isfile("{}.wav".format(i))
             if check:
                 new_files.append(i)
         joined_command = ['{}.wav'.format(x) for x in new_files]
         joined_command = ' '.join(joined_command)
         os.system('sox {} big.wav'.format(joined_command))
         os.system('mplayer big.wav')
         os.system('rm *wav')
   #+end_src

** List files [0/1]
   + [ ] Expand to list running time of files on queue.
   A simple fuction that just lists all the files on the queue.
   
   *List* *Lit.py*
   #+name:list
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     def list_files():
         k = read_queue()
         print("The size of the queue is {}".format(len(k)))
         for i in k:
             print(i)
   #+END_SRC

* TODO User guide [0/1]
  + Listen to clipboard: q -ap
  + Add clipboard to queue q -a
  + Listen to queue q -p
  + Create a merged file from all files on queue q -j
  + [ ] Get -j to be an option with the named file q -j name.
  
* TODO Plan
  
** Add testing
   Create another file testing.py that runs tests on the files.
   Testing should have no impact on how you write the code.
  
** Spin off own threads for song creation. 

** Make file to extract the code from org file.
   
** Create a deamon that plays any enqueued songs.

** Redo code with better data structures.
   

** TODO Extensoin [1/1]
   + [X] Expand this to have an endless loop that constantly plays back files if any are present.

* COMMENT Code
  All files named as hashes to avoid collisions.
  Command line options 
  + [ ] Add commandline options that are mutually exclisive.
  + [ ] Add threads to run the espeak commands on their own proccess.
  + [X] Use path library.
